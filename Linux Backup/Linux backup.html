    <p>The backup. Wateredge_Ltd.tar.gz folder contains all the folders and files in the Wateredge_Ltd folder. You can copy it and unzip it to get the entire structure on another location or host.</p>
    <h2>Log the backup:</h2>
    <p>You create a file for logging the date, time, and file name of the backup tar file that you created. This file indicates when you created backups and could be useful to avoid creating unnecessary backups in the future. To navigate to the Wateredge_Ltd folder, enter the following command into the terminal and press Enter:  cd Wateredge_Ltd</p>

        echo "24 June 2024, 13:35, backup. Wateredge_Ltd.tar.gz" | sudo tee SharedFolders/backups <br>
