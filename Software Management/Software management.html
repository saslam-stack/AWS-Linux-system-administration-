<H2>Step 1:</H2>
<br>
<p>SSH to connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance (Download PuTTY to SSH into 
    the Amazon EC2 instance). To avoid time out, Open putty.exe and Configure 
    PuTTY timeout to keep the PuTTY session open for a longer period of time 
    (select connection and Set Seconds between keepalives to 30).

<br>
<p>Paste the Public DNS or IPv4 address of the AWS Linux Ec2 instance  
    (Public DNS or IPv4 address can be found in the details section of  
    the EC2 instance on AWS management console e.g. 34.222.246.129).
</p>

<br>
<p>In puTTY browse and select the AWS private key (.ppk file) that was 
    downloaded during the launch of the AWS EC2 instance. In puTTY click on 
    the connections, expand SSH, expand Auth, click on credentials and browse 
    private key file for authentication to upload AWS secret keys), click open 
    at the bottom of the puTTY window and click on open again. When prompted 
    login as, enter: ec2-user

<br>
<h2>Step2 </h2>
<br>
<p>To query repositories for available updates you need to be in that         
    specific folder e.g. I have a company folder called Dio_ltd, to validate 
    that you are in the Dio_ltd home folder, enter cd Dio_ltd 
</p>
<br>
<img src="./Images/pic5.png" alt="PuTTY, Dio_ltd folder">
<br>
<p>To check for available updates enter sudo yum -y check-update</p>
<br>
<img src="./Images/pic6.png" alt="PuTTY printscreen">
<br>
<p>To apply security-related updates, enter sudo yum update --security and 
    press Enter. 
</p>
<br>
<img src="./Images/pic7.png" alt="PuTTY printscreen">
<br>
<p>To update packages, enter sudo yum -y upgrade and press Enter.</p>
<br>
<img src="./Images/pic8.png" alt="puTTY printscreen">
<br>
<p>Pic. PuTTY shows no updates available. Once the sudo yum -y upgrade 
    command is ran, the packages are updated and the system will let you know 
    that you are running the current updated version.
