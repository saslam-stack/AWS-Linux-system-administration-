    Open a terminal window, and change directory cd to the directory 
        where the cvpkey.pem file was downloaded. For example, if the 
        cvpkey.pem file was saved to your Downloads directory, run this 
        command:   cd ~/Downloads <br>
   
    Change the permissions on the key to be read-only, by running this 
        command: chmod 400 cvpkey.pem <br>

    Run the this  command  ssh -i cvpkey.pem ec2-user@<public-ip> 
        (replace <public-ip> with the PublicIP address you copied earlier) 
        e.g. ssh -i cvpkey.pem ec2-user@34.222.246.129 <br>
    
    Type yes when prompted to allow the first connection to this 
        remote SSH server. No password would be required because you are
